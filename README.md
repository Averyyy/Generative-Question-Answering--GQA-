# GenerativeQA

GenerativeQA is a project that uses machine learning to generate answers to questions based on a provided context.

## Training the Model

You can train the model by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will start the training process. The progress of the training will be displayed in your terminal.

## Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate answers to questions. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python inference.py
```

This will start the inference process. You will be prompted to enter a question and a context for the model to generate an answer from.

## Requirements

This project requires Python, and has several Python library dependencies, including PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and BERT Score.
